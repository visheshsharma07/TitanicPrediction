# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages
# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

#library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
#library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function
library(rpart)
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

#system("ls ../input")

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
